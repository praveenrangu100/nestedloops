# nestedloops
Nested loops in Java are loops that are placed inside other loops. They are used to repeat a specific block of code for a certain number of times.

For example, suppose we want to print a pattern of stars in the shape of a triangle. We can use nested loops to accomplish this task.

For Loop: A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to be executed a specific number of times. The for loop has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
statement(s);
}

While Loop: A while loop is a control structure that allows you to repeat a task a certain number of times. The while loop evaluates the condition first, and if it is true, then the code inside the loop is executed. The while loop continues to run as long as the condition is true.
Syntax:
while (condition) {
statement(s);
}

Do-While Loop: A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, except that the code inside the loop is executed at least once before the condition is evaluated. The do-while loop continues to run as long as the condition is true.
Syntax:
do {
statement(s);
} while (condition);
