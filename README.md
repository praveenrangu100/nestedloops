# nestedloops
Nested loops in Java are loops that are placed inside other loops. They are used to repeat a specific block of code for a certain number of times.

For example, suppose we want to print a pattern of stars in the shape of a triangle. We can use nested loops to accomplish this task.

First, we can use a for loop to iterate over the rows of the triangle. Then, within that for loop, we can use another for loop to iterate over the columns of each row and print a star for each column.
